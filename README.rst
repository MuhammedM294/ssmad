================================================
Surface Soil Moisture Anomaly Detection Workflow (in progress)
================================================


Overview
--------

SSMAD (Surface Soil Moisture Anomaly Detection) is a workflow designed to compute climate normals and anomalies of ASCAT surface soil moisture data in the context of flood and drought monitoring.

Features
--------

- **ASCAT Data Processing**: Efficiently processes ASCAT surface soil moisture data.
- **Climate Normals Calculation**: Computes climate normals for surface soil moisture.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies anomalies in surface soil moisture based on computed normals.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations to aid in interpreting results.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation to guide users through the workflow.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with SSMAD, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ::

      git clone https://github.com/MuhammedM294/ssmad.git
      cd ssmad

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ::

      pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Workflow:**

   ::

      python run_workflow.py
